Unfortunately, my 'completed' app is a single component project due to my inability to pass props. However, this is definitely something I'm going to research further and figure out.",

This was a great learning experience and sparked my interest in both TypeScript and Ionic. I look forward to learning more, going back to this project's repo, and refactoring as I get past some of the things that stumped me."

            "While I liked all the topics covered in prework, there were unique things about each that I found difficult. GitHub was easy to begin working with, but communicating between GitHub and the terminal was challenging. HTML and CSS as a pair were fairly straightforward in how they relate to one another, but I struggled particularly with padding and margin within CSS. JavaScript has been both the most likeable and most difficult topic; I've love the logical thinking required and how all the pieces fit together, however, there are a lot of pieces and learning them all has been overwhelming.",
            "What was helpful?",
            "A few things helped me during the prework. The first was the #help channel in Slack. I asked a lot of questions and learned a lot from the instructors, as well as the other students. The other help was learning about pseudo-coding. I can see how this will be invaluable when approaching bigger, more complicated projects--especially involving JavaScript.",
            "What hindered your progress?",
            "I didn't feel too hindered throughout prework, however, I think I could have jumped into the projects and assignments sooner than I did each week. I spent a good bit of time reading documentation and trying to understand thoroughly before getting my hands dirty. I think I would have been helped more by getting into the code myself instead of reading so much.",
            "How did you overcome challenges?",
            "The challenges during prework were overcome by plodding. By that I mean simply coming back to the problems each day, giving them time and effort, and doing the work necessary to move forward. I don't think there's going to be any magic bullets with web development but rather--like anything else--it's going to come down to showing up each day and taking a few steps forward."

            "I really like how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. It makes conceptual sense to me, and the little bit I’ve grasped thus far has enabled me to do some pretty cool things with my blog (the dropdown navbar and footer icons in particular). I’m a little concerned about my ability to keep all the sheets “clean”--creating various classes to make all the features move how I want seems to get out of hand at times--but I’m sure that will come with time!",

            "In terms of the three tools’ ability to provide user experience, I’m excited to keep learning. JavaScript in particular seems to be a really powerful tool with endless possibilities for functionality and user experience. So far, my blog incorporates various objects to improve user experience. The main object being the navigation bar. It’s HTML and CSS code enable it to change color on click and hover, as well as incorporate dropdown sections under “Projects” and “Blog”. Also, the blog features a footer which contains two icons linked to my personal LinkedIn profile and Twitter page. In the future, I hope to implement JavaScript to loop through text on the home page (“Learning HTML”, “Learning CSS”, “Learning JavaScript”, etc.)."

The language itself seems very logical which is helpful for me. The high-level, descriptive nature of pseudo code is helpful for me as I come at programming as a beginner; having a tool like this to layout big-picture components with easy to understand comments will be a huge help!",

            "It’s less of a specific struggle and more like walking around in the dark--I spent a good bit of time looking at code for certain features, manipulating it, seeing what changed and what didn’t, and trying to understand everything. This poking around feels a little like a “struggle” but it’s also leading to some helpful discoveries and, I hope, a better working grasp on the overall process.",

            "After playing around with this blog for a day or so, experimenting with fixed navigation bars, margin, gradient colors, etc., I’m eager to become more familiar with the capabilities of CSS. Specifically, I’m excited to learn more about the box model and how it can be used to incorporate features like drop down navigation bars and aside content. Wading into CSS this past week has increased my interest in and awareness of all the websites I frequent--I’m gaining a better eye for good design and usability!"
